  anysize               This patch allows st to resize to any pixel size, makes the inner border
                        size dynamic, and centers the content of the terminal so that the
                        left/right and top/bottom borders are balanced. With this patch, st on a
                        tiling WM will always fill the entire space allocated to it

                          - echo -e -n "\x1b[\x31 q" # Blinking block (default)
                          - echo -e -n "\x1b[\x32 q" # Steady block
                          - echo -e -n "\x1b[\x33 q" # Blinking underline
                          - echo -e -n "\x1b[\x34 q" # Steady underline
                          - echo -e -n "\x1b[\x35 q" # Blinking bar
                          - echo -e -n "\x1b[\x36 q" # Steady bar
                          - echo -e -n "\x1b[\x37 q" # Blinking st cursor
